# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

This Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into by and between the undersigned contributor (“You” or
“Contributor”) and Wagyourtail (“Owner”).

## 0. Preamble

The purpose of this CLA is to allow for me to use your code under the terms of commercial licenses
as well as distributing it under the open-source license terms.

To allow for that you must allow for your contribution to be licensed under wider terms than the main project license.

## 1. Definitions

**“Contribution”** means any original work of authorship,
including any modifications or additions to an existing work,
that is intentionally submitted by You to the Owner for inclusion in, or documentation of,
any of the projects owned or managed by the Owner (the “Project”).

## 2. Grant of Rights

You hereby grant to the Owner, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
sublicense, relicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

Relicensing under this grant will require that your work is also still available under its initial license terms,
merely that license terms that are not-consistent with the original license can also be provided for your contribution.
For example for the purpose of removing some license requirements in order to create a commercial/support agreement.

## 3. Moral Rights

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, You hereby waive, and agree not to assert,
all of Your “moral rights” in or relating to Your Contributions for the benefit of the Owner,
its assigns, and their respective direct and indirect licensees.

## 4. Representations and Warranties

You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license.
f your employer has rights to intellectual property that you create,
you represent that you have received permission to make the Contributions on behalf of that employer,
or that your employer has waived such rights for the Contributions to the Owner.

You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation, or that you have the legal right to treat it as
such.

You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other
restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks)
of which You are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

## 5. No Obligation

You acknowledge that the Owner is under no obligation to use or incorporate Your Contributions into the Project. The
decision to use or incorporate Your Contributions will be made at the sole discretion of the Owner.

## 6. Notice to Owner

You agree to notify the Owner of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these
representations inaccurate in any respect.

## 7. Governing Law

This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without regard to
conflict of laws principles.

## 8. Entire Agreement

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, regarding such subject
matter.
