# JvmDowngrader Commercial License Agreement

## Preamble

This document is not necessarily the license in itself,
but guidelines on how the license will be formed.

If you are interested in a commercial license, please email me with the terms you require at the email
from [the main license file](../LICENSE.md).

## Commercial evaluation

If you are a commercial user looking to validate this software for your use-case,
you are welcome to use the software for evaluation purposes, but depending on your software, you may not be able to
distribute it as widely as you'd like,
in which case must purchase a license before using it in a production environment.
If you are in need of more evaluation options, or have any questions, please contact me at the email address above.
I am willing to allow for some wider evaluation licensing if necessary,
the terms of which will be recorded as a commercial license but may not require any exchange of money.

## Construction

Commercial copies of JvmDowngrader will be allowed with exceptions to the LGPL license up to the point of, essentially,
allowing for the distribution of the java-api as part of a combined work without requiring certain aspects, like sharing
source code.

The specific terms of what gets exempted are negotiable,
and may be as lenient as BSD-3-Clause but without the ability to redistribute jvmdowngrader in its entirety under said
license,
in order to prevent that from becoming the main open-source license of the project.

## Support Agreement

Commercial licenses may additionally include a support agreement, this can cover

* Adding features
* Bugfixes

and more, to ensure the software is supported in a timely manner.

## Transparency

Any commercial licenses created will be publicly available under this license folder on the repository,
with the exception of the agreement cost, and may be used for further commercial licenses.
